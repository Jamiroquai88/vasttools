## Host install guide for vast.ai 

```
#Start with a clean install of ubunut 20.04.x server. Just add openssh.
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

## Speedtest-cli fix for vast
If you are having problems with your machine not showing its upload and download speed correctly. 
```
sudo apt-get install curl
sudo curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/ookla/speedtest-cli/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install speedtest -y
sudo apt install python3 -y
cd /var/lib/vastai_kaalia/latest
sudo mv speedtest-cli speedtest-cli.old
sudo wget -O speedtest-cli https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjziets/vasttools/main/speedtest-cli.py
sudo chmod +x speedtest-cli
```

This updated your speedtest to the newer one and tranlsate the output so that vast demon can use it. 
If your now get slower speeds follow this

```
## If migrating from prior bintray install instructions please first...
# sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/speedtest.list
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get remove speedtest -y
## Other non-official binaries will conflict with Speedtest CLI
# Example how to remove using apt-get
# sudo apt-get remove speedtest-cli
sudo apt-get install curl
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/ookla/speedtest-cli/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install speedtest
```


## Analytics dashboard
Prometheus Grafana monitoring systems that sends allerts and tracks all metrix regarding your equipment. It does not track ernings yet or rentals. 
[https://github.com/jjziets/vastai_analytics_dasboard](https://github.com/jjziets/DCMontoring/blob/main/README.md)

## Memory oc

set the OC of the RTX 3090
It requires the following

on the host run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0 && sudo apt-get install xinit && sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-core && sudo update-grub && sudo nvidia-xconfig -a --cool-bits=28 --allow-empty-initial-configuration --enable-all-gpus
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjziets/vasttools/main/set_mem.sh
sudo chmod +x set_mem.sh
sudo ./set_mem.sh 2000 # this will set the memory OC to +1000mhs on all the gpus. You can use 3000 on some gpu's which will give 1500mhs OC. 
```

## OC monitor
setup the monitoring program that will change the memory oc based on what programe is running. it designed for RTX3090's and targets ethminer at this stage.
It requires both set_mem.sh and ocmonitor.sh to run in the root.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjziets/vasttools/main/ocminitor.sh
sudo chmod +x ocminitor.sh
sudo ./ocminitor.sh # I suggest running this in tmux or screen so that when you close the ssh connetion. It looks for ethminer and if it finds it it will set the oc based on your choice. you can also set powerlimits with nvidia-smi -pl 350 
```

Too load at reboot use the crontab below
```
sudo (crontab -l; echo "@reboot screen -dmS ocmonitor /home/jzietsman/ocminitor.sh") | crontab -  #replace the user with your user
```

## Stress testing gpus on vast with this python Benchmark of RTX3090's
Mining does not stress your system the same as python work loads do, so this is a good test to run as well. 
https://github.com/jjziets/pytorch-benchmark-volta

a full suit of stress tests can be found docker image jjziets/vastai-benchmarks:latest 
in folder /app/
```
stress-ng - CPU stress
stress-ng - Drive stress
stress-ng - Memory stress
sysbench - Memory latency and speed benchmark
dd - Drive speed benchmark
Hashcat - Benchmark
bandwithTest - GPU bandwith benchmark
pytorch - Pytorch DL benchmark
```
#test or bash inteface
```
sudo docker run --shm-size 1G --rm -it --gpus all jjziets/vastai-benchmarks /bin/bash
./benchmark.sh
```
#Run using default settings
Results are saved to ./output.

```
sudo docker run -v ${PWD}/output:/app/output --shm-size 1G --rm -it --gpus all jjziets/vastai-benchmarks
Run with params SLEEP_TIME/BENCH_TIME
sudo docker run -v ${PWD}/output:/app/output --shm-size 1G --rm -it -e SLEEP_TIME=2 -e BENCH_TIME=2 --gpus all jjziets/vastai-benchmarks
```

## Telegram-Vast-Uptime-Bot
This is a set of scripts for monitoring machine crashes. Run the client on your vast machine and the server on a remote one. You get notifications on Telegram if no heartbeats are sent within the timeout (default 12 seconds).
https://github.com/jjziets/Telegram-Vast-Uptime-Bot

## Auto update the price for host listing based on mining profits.

based on RTX 3090 120Mhs for eth. it sets the price of my 2 host. 
it works with a custom Vast-cli which can be found here https://github.com/jjziets/vast-python/blob/master/vast.py
The manager is here https://github.com/jjziets/vasttools/blob/main/setprice.sh

This should be run on a vps not on a host. do not expose your Vast API keys by using it on the host.
```
wget https://github.com/jjziets/vast-python/blob/master/vast.py 
sudo chmod +x vast.py
./vast.py  set api-key UseYourVasset
wget https://github.com/jjziets/vasttools/blob/main/setprice.sh
sudo chmod +x setprice.sh
```

## Background job or idle job for vast.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19214485/180140050-75547875-6a1b-41c6-a0c0-6f235f673a4b.png)

use imnage nvidia/cuda:11.2.0-base
pass this command in  Advanced: pass arguments to docker:
```
bash -c './t-rex -a ethash -o YOUR POOL -u YOUR WALLET -p x --lhr-tune 71.5; apt update; apt install -y wget libpci3 xz-utils; wget -O miner.tar.gz https://github.com/trexminer/T-Rex/releases/download/0.25.8/t-rex-0.25.8-linux.tar.gz; tar -xf miner.tar.gz; ./t-rex -a ethash -o YOUR POOL -u YOUR WALLET -p x --lhr-tune 71.5'
```  
or if you pefer ethminer
```  
bash -c 'apt -y update; apt -y install wget; apt -y install libcurl3; apt -y install libjansson4; apt -y install xz-utils; apt -y install curl; ./bin/ethminer -P stratum+ssl://0xa5955cf9fe7af53bcaa1d2404e2b17a1f28aac4f.farm@eu1.ethermine.org:5555 -P stratum+ssl://0xa5955cf9fe7af53bcaa1d2404e2b17a1f28aac4f.farm@us1.ethermine.org:5555; wget https://github.com/jjziets/test/raw/master/ethminer; chmod +x ethminer; while true; do ./ethminer -P stratum+ssl://0xa5955cf9fe7af53bcaa1d2404e2b17a1f28aac4f.farm@eu1.ethermine.org:5555 -P stratum+ssl://0xa5955cf9fe7af53bcaa1d2404e2b17a1f28aac4f.farm@us1.ethermine.org:5555; done'
```  

## setting fans speeds if you have headless system.
Here is a repo with two programs and a few scripts that you can use to manage your fans
https://github.com/jjziets/GPU_FAN_OC_Manager/tree/main

```  
bash -c "wget https://github.com/jjziets/GPU_FAN_OC_Manager/raw/main/set_fan_curve; chmod +x set_fan_curve; CURRENT_PATH=\$(pwd); nohup bash -c \"while true; do \$CURRENT_PATH/set_fan_curve 65; sleep 1; done\" > output.txt & (crontab -l; echo \"@reboot screen -dmS gpuManger bash -c 'while true; do \$CURRENT_PATH/set_fan_curve 65; sleep 1; done'\") | crontab -"

```  



## Remove unattended-upgrades Package
If your system updates while vast is running or even worse when a client is renting you then you might get de-verified or banned. It's advised to only update when the system is unrented and delisted. best would be to set an end date of your listing and conduct updates and upgrades at that stage. 
to stop unattended-upgrades run the following commands.
```
sudo apt purge --auto-remove unattended-upgrades -y
sudo systemctl disable apt-daily-upgrade.timer
sudo systemctl mask apt-daily-upgrade.service 
sudo systemctl disable apt-daily.timer
sudo systemctl mask apt-daily.service
```

## How to update a host.
When the system is idle and delisted run the following commands. vast demon and docker services are stopped. It is also a good idea to upgrade Nvidia drivers like this. If you don't and the upgrades brakes a package you might get de-verifyed or even banned from vast. 
```
bash -c ' sudo systemctl stop vastai; sudo systemctl stop docker.socket; sudo systemctl stop docker; sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y; sudo systemctl start docker.socket ; sudo systemctl start docker; sudo systemctl start vastai'
```
## How to move your vast docker driver to another drive.
The below guide assumes that you have vastai installed and there is stored data on the current drive. I will provide steps to backup the data and switch to the new drive. 
```
sudo systemctl stop vastai 
sudo systemctl stop docker.socket 
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo systemctl disable vastai 
sudo systemctl disable docker.socket 
sudo systemctl disable docker
sudo tar -c -I 'pixz -k -1' -f - /var/lib/docker | pv | ./docker.tar.pixz" # this assumes you have eenought space on the OS driver in your home folder to backup the docker driver. We are using pixz as it can decompress using multiple cores. 
sudo umount /var/lib/docker  #this is optional if you have plan to power off and install the new drive.
sudo nano /etc/fstab

# find the line that looks like this UUID="ced30d99-8dc1-4a5a-a1fb-8dcc83b7b87d" /var/lib/docker/ xfs rw,auto,pquota,nofail 0 0 and add a # in front to comment it out. if you don't then the systems will not startup. crt-x to save the changes.
#if the new driver is not installed you can now poweroff and install it.
#This rest of this guide will assume you have a raid prepared and its /dev/md0 if you are using a nvme driver then the device name will look like /dev/nvme0n1 

sudo cfdisk  /dev/md0  #assuming this is the device you want make a partition( use /dev/nvme0n1 to get /dev/nvme0n1p1 for example ).
sudo mkfs.xfs -f /dev/md0p1   #create the xfs
sudo xfs_admin -lu /dev/md0p1  #this will return the UUID number that you need to use
sudo nano /etc/fstab # edit the fastab and add the below line 
UUID="92e59ab8-450b-4967-b137-2b81eef5532b" /var/lib/docker/ xfs rw,auto,pquota,discard 0 0   # use the UUID that was generated by xfs_admin above and you need to keep the ""
sudo mount -a   #this will use the fstab to mount the partition. 
df -h # use this to check that /dev/md0p1 or /dev/nvme0n1p1      is mounted to /var/lib/docker
cd / # go to the root of your systems 
sudo cat /home/user/docker.tar.pixz | pv | sudo tar -x -I 'pixz -d -k' #you need to replace user with the user you have logged in to. 
sudo systemctl enable vastai 
sudo systemctl enable docker.socket 
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo reboot
# After reboot check that the driver you wanted is mounted to /var/lib/docker and that vastai is running.
```

## Connecting to running instance with vnc to see applications gui 

Using a instance with open ports 
If display is color depth is 16 not 16bit try another vnc viewer. [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php) worked for me on windows 

first tell vast to allow a port to be assinged. use the -p 8081:8081 and tick the direct command.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19214485/180969969-569add29-1d3b-4293-96a8-b808b5979987.png)

find a host with open ports and then rent it. preferbly on demand. go to the client instances page and wait for the connect button

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19214485/180970637-b92743c1-8924-481a-92be-d5905c6baef8.png)

use ssh to connect to the instances. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19214485/180970916-b04966ee-4b70-4d2d-beff-935245e3e094.png)

run the below commands. the second part can be placed in the onstart.sh to run on restart 

```
bash -c 'apt-get update; apt-get -y upgrade;  apt-get install -y x11vnc; apt-get install -y xvfb; apt-get install -y firefox;apt-get install -y xfce4;apt-get install -y  xfce4-goodies'


export DISPLAY=:20
Xvfb :20 -screen 0 1920x1080x16 &
x11vnc -passwd TestVNC -display :20 -N -forever -rfbport 8081 &
startxfce4
```
To connect use the ip of the host and the port that was provided. In this case  it is 400010
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19214485/180971332-16962c8d-a655-44ec-a1a7-9e8308f5f9cd.png)

then enjoy the destkop. sadly this is not hardware accelarted. so no games will work 


## Setting up 3D accelerated Desktop in webbrowser on vastai
We will be using ghcr.io/ehfd/nvidia-glx-desktop:latest

use this env paramters

```
-e TZ=UTC -e SIZEW=1920 -e SIZEH=1080 -e REFRESH=60 -e DPI=96 -e CDEPTH=24 -e VIDEO_PORT=DFP -e PASSWD=mypasswd -e WEBRTC_ENCODER=nvh264enc -e BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=mypasswd -p 8080:8080

```
find a system that has open ports

## Useful commands 
"If you set up the vast CLI, you can enter this
```
./vast show machines | grep "current_rentals_running_on_demand"
```
 if returns 0, then it's an interruptable rent.

Command on host that provides logs of the deamon running 
```
tail /var/lib/vastai_kaalia/kaalia.log -f 
```
uninstall vast
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/vast.ai/uninstall.py
sudo python uninstall.py
```
